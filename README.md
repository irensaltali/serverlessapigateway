Welcome to the Serverless API Gateway, an innovative tool designed to streamline your API management tasks using the powerful capabilities of Cloudflare Workers.

## Features

- **JS Workers**: Write serverless JavaScript workers that intercept and modify your API requests and responses on the fly.
- **Routing (Path and Method)**: Simplify your API architecture with flexible path and method-based routing for directing traffic to the appropriate endpoints.
- **CORS (Basic)**: Manage cross-origin resource sharing settings with ease, ensuring your APIs can securely handle requests from different origins.
- **Auth (JWT)**: Secure your APIs by implementing JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication to validate and manage user access efficiently.
- **Service Binding**: Bind your API to a service as Workers, so you can use the Workers capabilities within your API.
- **Value Mapping**: Map values from sources to destinations, allowing you to easily transform your data.

## Motivation

APIs are pivotal in the landscape of modern applications, but they bring forth a unique set of challenges regarding security, routing, and overall management. The Serverless API Gateway emerged from the need to address these issues in a reliable, manageable, and cost-effective way. Built upon Cloudflare's serverless infrastructure, this project provides developers with a lightweight yet robust toolkit that adapts to the unpredictability of internet scale and traffic. Our mission is to empower developers to securely and efficiently manage their APIs without the overhead of managing infrastructure.


For detailed setup and usage instructions, please see the [Serverless API Gateway documentation](https://docs.serverlessapigateway.com).
